# Submission Process

Participants must Dockerize their trained network/algorithm/method and will submit these, via file-sharing link (e.g. OneDrive, Dropbox) to the organizers through e-mail to [`muregpro@gmail.com`](mailto:muregpro@gmail.com). 

The e-mail submission must contain:

- Team name;
- Team affiliation and country (e.g. University College London, United Kingdom).
- Full name(s) of all team members;
- Brief description of method (100 characters maximum);
- File-sharing link to Dockerized algorithm;
- Whether any additional data was used.

Receipt of all submissions will be acknowledged by e-mail, and submissions will be evaluated and posted to the leaderboard within 2 working days of receipt.

The evaluation code to evaluate the registration algorithms will be made publicly available at the same time that that section of the challenge becomes available to enter (July 3 2023).

Participating teams' are encouraged, but not required, to make their code publicly available. We will provide links to any available source code on the challenge website.
